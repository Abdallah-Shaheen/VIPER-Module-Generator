Are you new to VIPER Design Pattern? Want to Learn it But feel overwhelemed of all the files you have to create?

When you decide to use VIPER architecture in your project, it feels overwhelming to create new modules, because you need create at least 5 files for each. Imagine that you need to create 6 modules...We were suffering of this problem, and this is the reason why We've created this template. It's very useful for us and I hope that it be useful for you too.

## Available Options:
* [x] BaseViewProtocol - A Common Functions Placeholder.
----
* [x] With Generic Functions - Protocols with Generic Functions ready for implementation.
* [x] Without Generic Functions.

### UI Ready Implementation.
* [x] Both Options With & Without Generic Functions contains a UI file ready for Implemntation.

## How to install

#### Using script (easy)
Only need execute this command in terminal:
```swift
sudo swift install.swift
```

## Generated code
This template generates all files that you need to create a new VIPER module. All generated code is Swift 4.

```swift
YourFileNameUI for UI as UIView instead of Storyboards.
VYourFileName for View.
IYourFileName for Interactor.
PYourFileName for Presenter.
EYourFileName for Entity.
RYourFileName for Router (Wireframe).
```

You should be this output message:

If all it's ok you now could find your template in Xcode.

### Manual
Go to Application folder, browse to the Xcode application icon. Right-click it and choose 'Show Package Contents'. Then browse to:
`Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/Project Templates/iOS/Application` and add "Module VIPER.xctemplate" file. Now you can find your template in Xcode.

## Why VIPER?
After using VIPER, I've found it to be very beneficial in many ways. Letâ€™s get back to the list of things we set out to accomplish when architecting our app to see if VIPER addresses them.

- Easy to iterate on
- Collaboration friendly
- Separated out concerns
- Spec-ability

## Next steps

Would you like decide what will be the next feature?

* [x] Create bash script to install more easy
* [x] Divide Interactor protocol (Input & Output) (**NEW!** Version 1.1)
* [x] Swift 4 & XCode 9 (**NEW!** Version 1.2)
* [ ] Create Data Layer for Interactor Implementations.
